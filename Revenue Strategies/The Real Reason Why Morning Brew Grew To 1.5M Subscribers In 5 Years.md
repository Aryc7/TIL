# Morning Brew's Growth

The folks over at Growth.Design did an amazing case study on how [Morning Brew](https://growth.design/case-studies/morning-brew-newsletter-retention) dominated the business newsletter industry. 

Insights such as...

1. Emojis - Morning Brew tends to use emojis in their subject lines to stand out amongst all the other newsletters in an inbox.

2. Copywriting - implementing Tone of Voice, deciding the tone (personality) and voice (context-situation) writing style for their business-oriented audience.

3. Readability - The UX design is always taken into account for a product but never the writing aka UX writing, users need to easily digest info.

4. Enough White Space - This pattern allows for a better flow of readability that makes images, headlines, and call-to-actions stand out.

5. Gamification - A referral program that gives users credits based on the amount of people they have referred.
