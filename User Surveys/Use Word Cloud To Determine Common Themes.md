Synthesizing qualitative data can be tricky and time-consuming. Using a [word cloud](https://www.wordclouds.com/?ref=review.firstround.com) can speed up the process to highlight keywords. Let's use [Superhuman's word cloud discovery](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/) as an example.

“Processing email is much faster with Superhuman for two reasons: show one email at a time and overall speed is much better than gmail. I get through my inbox in half the time.”

“Speed! The app is crazy fast, and the UX + keyboard shortcuts make me an actual superhuman.”

“Using Superhuman is so much faster than using Gmail. Not even close. And it mirrors my favorite Gmail shortcuts, so there is zero learning curve for a power Gmailer.”

“I can work through incoming email more quickly, sorting messages accordingly and streamlining my work process.”

“Speed. Aesthetics. I can do everything from the keyboard.”

“Speed and the great set of keyboard shortcuts. I rarely, if ever, have to use the trackpad.”
