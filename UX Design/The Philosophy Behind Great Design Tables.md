# A retrospective on tables

[Great tables](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/blog/design-philosophy/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=design) performs a deep dive on data tables. From going far as when they were presented on stone during the Mesopotamia era (1850 BC), that was earliest sign of tables being systematically structured to display and organize information/data. 

To the 20th century, tables took on a new complex form on paper. 

To now being on the computer and how that layout looks digitally. 

I'm always inspired by the designs we don't really think of in our day-to-day that typically pass without a second thought. That's when, you know, you've managed to design something that is super user-friendly, that people don't even realize how easy and natural it is while they're using it.

Whatâ€™s the ideal design for a system table look like to you?
