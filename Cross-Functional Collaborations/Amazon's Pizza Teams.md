# The Dynamics of Pizza Teams

No team should be bigger than 10 people AKA it shouldn't take more than two full pizzas to feed a team.

[Amazon encourages internal teams to be small](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/amazon-two-pizza-team/). This is to reduce communication lines, improve decision-making, and avoid bureaucracy.

The Ringelmann effect says the bigger the team the less productive they are. A smaller team allows for there to be efficient group productivity.

Increased headcounts worsen lines of communication.

- 3 people = 3 lines of communications
- 4 people = 6 lines of communications
- 5 people = 10 lines of communications
- 6 people = 15 lines of communications

Misalignment will naturally happen with a higher number of lines of communication. That's why it's important to keep a team as small but as efficient as possible.
