# Superhuman's Product Market Fit
Rahul Vohra - CEO of [Superhuman](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/) breaks down tactical and practical solutions for their path towards Product Market Fit. An email app that ensures a smoother User Experience for managing your inbox along with various other features. 

He admits that they struggled to find their place in the email marketplace two years after the company was founded. They launched a survey to figure out what they should focus on, the main question being "How would you feel if you could no longer use Superhuman?". 

After that, they decided to attach a person to each user who filled out the survey. With this analysis, they finally discovered which persona group would be unhappy/disappointed if their product ceased to exist. Although, that was just the tip of the iceberg for identifying PMF.
