# How to use PMF Survey  
The [implemenation](https://www.startup-marketing.com/) is fairly simple - ask your users how they would feel if they could no longer use your product?

If over 40% of users said they would be "very disappointed" if they could no longer use your product, you've discovered a path to scalability and growth.

If the number was below 40% then you need to back to the drawing and see what you could do to improve the existing product.

Questions should remain open ended as possible and identifying User Peronas before launch of the survey helps with grouping specific identities 

Using a word cloud can help with synthesizing.
