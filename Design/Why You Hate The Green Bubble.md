The green iMessage bubble is a key example of why design matters in software development. The green bubble tends to get a lot of hate. It's an obvious indicator that you are texting with an Android user. However, besides indicating that you are texting with an Android user, there is another specific reason of why the green bubble isn't visually appealing. The answer lies in color contrast. The blue iMessage bubble has a good color contrast between the white font and the blue background, whereas the green bubble has a poor contrast. The dark blue matches very well with the white font, while the green is a bit too light and almost seems to blend in perfectly with the white font, making it a bit more visually impairing to read the text correctly. When going through an accessibility test, the blue iMessage bubble passes while the green iMessage bubble fails with a very poor indicator message.
